# Hello Tailwind Variables

This repository demonstrates the Tailwind CSS with Global Variables Pattern, showing how to implement a flexible, maintainable theming system.

This repository is an example implementation of the [Tailwind CSS with Global Variables Pattern](https://patterns.mkbrechtel.dev/development/frontend/tailwind-with-global-css-variables). The pattern provides a structured approach to manage theming in Tailwind CSS applications using CSS custom properties while maintaining the utility-first workflow.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Multiple pre-defined themes (light, dark, system preference)
- ðŸ“± Fully responsive design
- ðŸŒ— Respects user's system preference for dark/light mode
- â™¿ WCAG AA compliant color contrast in all themes

## How It Works

This project demonstrates the Tailwind CSS with Global Variables Pattern with:

- CSS custom properties defined in `variables.css`
- Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js` that references these variables
- Example HTML that uses the theming system

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
